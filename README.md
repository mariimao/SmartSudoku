# SmartSudoku

Welcome to SmartSudoku -- Sudoku with a twist!
For those who have played sudoku, the gameplay on _your_ end is simple: play the game how you would ordinarily play a sudoku game. For those who haven't, an _n_ × _n_ grid is completed when all the rows and columns are filled with numbers from 1 to _n_ completely, with no repeats. To make this extra challenging, there are _n_ separate √n × √n squares on the grid you will have to fill as well. For example, if you have chosen Easy mode, n = 4 and √n = 2. If this sounds complicated, you can read the rules in more detail on the official website <a href=https://sudoku.com/how-to-play/sudoku-rules-for-complete-beginners/>here</a>!

The twist of SmartSudoku is that every time you place a value on the board, the numbers on the board will scramble. Don't panic! You have 5 lives during the game, which is plently of room to make mistakes. Just make sure you finish within the 3-minute time limit.
